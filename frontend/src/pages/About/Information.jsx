      Hello there! I'm Pablo Archuleta, the creator and curator behind Weird World Attractions. This passion project was born out of my fascination with the bizarre, the unusual, and the downright weird that our world has to offer.

      At Weird World Attractions, we embark on a journey to explore the world's most peculiar and extraordinary destinations. From mysterious landmarks to offbeat museums, each entry in our catalog is a testament to the wonderfully weird and the delightfully odd.

      <h3 className='about-h3'>Why Weird?</h3>
      <p className='about-p'>
      Why focus on the weird, you ask? Well, because there's a unique charm in the eccentric, the unexpected, and the outlandish. I believe that every oddity has a story to tell, and it's these stories that make our world a fascinating tapestry of quirkiness.
